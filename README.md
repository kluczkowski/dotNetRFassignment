# RumbleFish .net login exercise
The goal of this exercise is to create a web application with login feature. It is intentionally open-ended and you are welcome to implement your solution using the language and tech stack of your choice, but the core functionality of the application should be expressed through your own original code. 

## Application Requirements

- When navigating to the root path (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/`) of the app in a browser a user should be asked for credentials .
- Backend and frontend separation is NOT obligatory but recommended, React was added to speed things up.
- When a user submits the form with proper login he should be redirected to dummy page that is pulling dummy data from api using JSON Web Tokens


## Deliverable
- Fork or clone this repository, feel free to create any structure or use existing one
- We will execute your code using the `make` targets specified in `Makefile`. Edit the contents of `Makefile` to provide an interface for running and testing your application.
- Backend app should create 1 dummy user

## Evaluation
Your submission will be evaluated along the following criteria by the Reviewer
- Completeness - Does your submission meet the Application Requirements and Deliverables specified above?
- Testing - evaluate your use of test coverage to allow for iterative development
- Ease of setup - how easy was it for the Reviewer to setup and run your app
- Front end design - what is your familiarity with html, css, and front-end javascript frameworks; how thoroughly did you consider the User Experience for this application?
- Technical design - separation of concerns, adherence to certain 12 factor App principles, knowledge of backend frameworks, security concerns, etc.

### Notes:  
- The hope is that this exercise will take a qualified candidate 1-4 hours. Please let us know how much time you spent so that we can iterate based on your feedback.  
- Thank you for the time you are spending as a candidate with Rumble Fish!
